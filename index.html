<p>Thank you for visiting. This is a work in progress page and I hope to see you again. Have a wonderful day!!</p> <p2>Novmeber 16th 2021:
    Tomorrow will be the start of a new chapter in my life and a way to gain new knowledge as I join others in the field of Software Development. I have no prior coding experience other than a few problems from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a> that has open my eyes to this field. There are currently so many amazing individuals in this field; my hope is to one day join them as a full stack developer. In order to help achieve this dream of mine, I'll be attending my first coding course at Promeino Tech bootcamp in their Front End Developer program. I'm so thankful for my husband and family who are my support system on this journey. Please send me lots of positive vibes and thoughts. I will add any additional updates to the bottom of this page and my first thought of my coding bootcamp.</p2>
