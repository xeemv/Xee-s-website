            <p>Novmeber 16th 2021:
                Tomorrow will be the start of a new chapter in my life and a way to gain new knowledge as I join others in the field of Software Development. I have no prior coding experience other than a few problems from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a> that has open my eyes to this field. There are currently so many amazing individuals in this field; my hope is to one day join them as a full stack developer. In order to help achieve this dream of mine, I'll be attending my first coding course at <a href="https://www.promineotech.com">Promineo Tech</a> in their Front End Developer program. I'm so thankful for my husband and family who are my support system on this journey. Please send me lots of positive vibes and thoughts. I will add any additional updates to the bottom of this page and my first thought of my coding bootcamp.
