<h3>Thank you for visiting. This is a work in progress page and I hope to see you again. Have a wonderful day!! </h3>
<P>Novmeber 16th 2021:
    Tomorrow will be the start of a new chapter in my life and a way to gain new knowledge as I join others in the field of coding. I have no prior coding experience other than a few problems from Free Code Camp that has open my eyes to this field. There are currently so many amazing women and BIPOC women in this field; my hope is to one day join them. In order to help achieve this dream of mine, I'll be attending my first coding course at Promeino Tech bootcamp in their Front End Developer program. I'm thankful for my husband and family who are my support system. Join me on this journey. Please send me lots of positive vibes and thoughts. I will add any additional updates to the bottom of this page and my first thought of my coding bootcamp.</P> 
<br></br>
<p2>In addition, I will also include a downloadable PDF of my current resume/CV for anyone who is interested in my personal work experience.
</P2>
